p. 8 of 112 - "A review of Borough purchase orders showed that many contained false vendor certifications, including such obviously bogus signatures as those of Santa Claus, Omar the Tentmaker, U.R. Stuck and Olive Oyl. All were approved for payment."
p. 37 of 113 - "One blatant example involved Ipri’s submission of a FEMA claim for $73,252 for damage to a municipal parking lot. FEMA disallowed the claim because it was the result of pre-existing, not storm- related, conditions. Mayor Hershey was questioned regarding Ipri’s attempt to obtain funds for the parking lot: Q. Are you aware that Leonard had attempted to submit a damage claim to FEMA for over seventy-three thousand dollars for storm damage to that lot in connection with the December of ‘92 storm? A. I got to give him a lot of credit for trying."
