## Seaside Heights (1997) - NJ Commission of Investigation


- p. 8 of 112 - "A review of Borough purchase orders showed that many contained false vendor certifications, including such obviously bogus signatures as those of Santa Claus, Omar the Tentmaker, U.R. Stuck and Olive Oyl. All were approved for payment."

- p. 37 of 112 - "One blatant example involved Ipri’s submission of a FEMA claim for $73,252 for damage to a municipal parking lot. FEMA disallowed the claim because it was the result of pre-existing, not storm- related, conditions. Mayor Hershey was questioned regarding Ipri’s attempt to obtain funds for the parking lot: Q. Are you aware that Leonard had attempted to submit a damage claim to FEMA for over seventy-three thousand dollars for storm damage to that lot in connection with the December of ‘92 storm? A. I got to give him a lot of credit for trying."

- p. 41 of 112 - "For example, in 1986 and 1987, signatures on purchase orders reflect the names of more than two dozen celebrities, notorious rogues, athletes and fictional characters. Signatures on Borough purchase orders included such bogus certifications as those of: Santa Claus, Buddy Holly, Olive Oyl, U.R. Stuck, Juan Valdez, Lawrence Taylor and Captain America."

- p. 46 of 112 - "Witnesses could not recall any instance when members of the Council refused to pay bills. In one case, Borough employees told the Commission that the Council had even approved a purchase order for a fleet of Cadillacs that had been submitted by staff, as a joke, to demonstrate the gross lack of review by the elected governing body."
